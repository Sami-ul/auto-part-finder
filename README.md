## Branching rules 
- When you start working on something new, do `git branch -b feature_name`
    - This creates a new branch on your local repository
- Then once you are done `git add .`, `git commit -m "feature description"`
    - This commits to your local branch
- `git push origin feature_name`
    - This pushes your local branch to the remote branch
- Once you are ready to pull your new feature into the main branch, go to github and make a pull request from `feature_name` to `main`
